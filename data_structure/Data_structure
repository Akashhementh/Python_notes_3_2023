CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete. It is a set of fundamental operations used to manipulate data in various systems,
 such as databases. Here's a brief explanation of each operation:
 
Create: Create involves inserting new data into a system. In the context of a database, it means adding a new record or entry.
Read: Read involves retrieving existing data from a system. It allows you to fetch and view data from the system, typically based on specified criteria.
Update: Update involves modifying existing data in a system. It allows you to change the values of specific attributes or fields in the data
Delete: Delete involves removing existing data from a system. It allows you to eliminate records or entries that are no longer needed.

		Here are the commonly used HTTP request methods for CRUD operations:
		
		GET:
				The GET method is used to retrieve or read data from a server.
		POST:
